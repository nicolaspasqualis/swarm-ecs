- allow explicit system ordering
- more advanced queries with support for common logic operators
- typed components for typescript clients
- allow alternatives to the primitive number-based bitmask implementation? uint arrays? bitmask "lists"? the idea is to support more than 32 comps
- more control over system executions, maybe single run, frame/time skipping? 
 - update policy function? I imagine that a stateful function/closure wich returns a boolean to evaluate on each tick if the system needs to run is enough
- open the ECS internals to be injected and allow more custom implementations
- remove entity array from ecs state, into EntityIndex
- remove plain strings as query index keys
- optimize entity object memory usage. wrapped classes?
