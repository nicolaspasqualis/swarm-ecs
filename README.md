## Design
- Indexed query results for constant-time lookup
- Bitmask based archetype resolution **limited to 32 components** per ECS instance
- Query support for ALL, ANY and NONE selectors
- Simple stage-based system execution ordering
- Typed component API
- OOP-like entity/component interface
- Archetypal architecture but without focus on memory layout/cache locality
